ChIPseq pipeline
================

I present here a simple pipeline to perform a basic ChIPseq analysis, from getting the FASTQ files, read preprocessing and mapping to peak calling. Annotation and differential binding analysis of peaks will be included in future versions of this pipeline.


UNDER CONSTRUCTION. IT WILL BE READY VERY SOON!!
